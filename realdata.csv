Honestly it's kinda noisy it is unfortunately very crowded and noise levels are everyone high and make impossible to savour the food,0
this restaurant is bad sadly needs better staff who are willing to keep it quiet and it is not uncommon of them to serve alcohol to people below the legal age ,0
however their food is good and if you come at the right time the experience is unparalleled,0
